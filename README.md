# I2P-Bote

I2P-Bote is a plugin for I2P that allows users to send and receive emails while preserving privacy. It does not need a mail server because emails are stored in a distributed hash table. They are automatically encrypted and digitally signed, which ensures no one but the intended recipient can read the email, and third parties cannot forge them.

**Features:**

  * Themeable webmail interface
  * User interface translated in many languages
  * One-click creation of email accounts (called email identities)
  * Emails can be sent under a sender identity, or anonymously
  * ElGamal, Elliptic Curve, and NTRU Encryption
  * Encryption and signing is transparent, without the need to know about PGP
  * Delivery confirmation
  * Basic support for short recipient names
  * IMAP / SMTP

**Planned Features:**

  * Custom folders
  * Sending and receiving via relays, similar to Mixmaster
  * Lots of small improvements
